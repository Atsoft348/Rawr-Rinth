rawr-rinth
==========

Rawr Rinth was an old action RPG I made back in 2008 with C++ and Allegro.
Now, I'm working on redoing it with C++ and SFML!

I am using my [Borka Framework](https://github.com/Moosader/borka), 
so if you pull Rawr Rinth's code, you'll also have to pull the Borka code.
This project has only Rawr-specific code!
